Woah, a website? This has gotta be the first of its kind!

# About me
I honestly have no idea what I'm doing here. But, I figure if I type enough here, you probably won't read it all... 
Is it working? No? Oh. Well, um. My name is **Mint**, if that wasn't obvious. It's nice to meet you! Or. It would be,
if I was meeting you. You're just kind of reading this text that I wrote days ago. Awful weather we're having, huh?

Hope you enjoy my website.

## My Favorite Things
- wasting time
- making stupid lists
- subjecting other people to my ideosyncratic tendencies
