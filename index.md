Ewwwww, this looks like an Xbox 360 Live Page. What is this, 2007?

Woah, a website? This has gotta be the first of its kind!

 About me
I honestly have no idea what I'm doing here. But, I figure if I type enough here, you probably won't read it all... 
Is it working? No? Oh. Well, um. My name is **Mint**, if that wasn't obvious. It's nice to meet you! Or. It would be,
if I was meeting you. You're just kind of reading this text that I wrote days ago. Awful weather we're having, huh?

Hope you enjoy my website.

 My Favorite Things
- wasting time
- making stupid lists
- subjecting other people to my ideosyncratic tendencies

# Mint's First CS193 Homework

My *Favorite* Things About CS193
- We have really cool teachers
- There were no rules on what could be in the website, as long as this was here
- um...
- 193 is the only odd prime known for which 2 is not a root to the solution of 4ùëù^2+1.
- also, according to the UN, there's 193 nations in the world.....
- also also: C is the 3rd letter of the alphabet and S is the 19th letter of the alphabet, so CS 193 is a lexi-numerical palindrome...
- are you still reading this? If so, our graders' tenacity is one of my favorite things about the class.
